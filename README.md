# RoomChat

RoomChat is a real-time chat application developed using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. It allows users to engage in conversations with their peers in a structured and efficient manner.

## Technologies Used

The frontend of the application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with custom Styled components. The backend is powered by Python Flask. The application employs SocketIO to facilitate real-time message exchange.

## Features

- Real-time message exchange: RoomChat uses SocketIO to enable users to send and receive messages in real time.
- Unique room codes: Users can generate a unique room code to create a designated room. Other users can join this room using the same code.

## Database

The application data is stored in a MySQL database.

## Development Status

Please note that RoomChat is currently under development. As the developer, I am continuously working on improving its features and fixing bugs. You might encounter some issues while using the application. I appreciate your understanding and patience.

Thank you for your interest in RoomChat!
